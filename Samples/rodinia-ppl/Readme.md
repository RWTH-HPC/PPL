<h1>Rodinia </h1>

This contains a translation of Rodinia 3.1 OpenMP version. The b+tree and mummerGPU codes are not translated, due to limitations regarding dynamic parallelism and the PPL respectively.

<h2>Benchmarks </h2>
For each benchmark, the folders contain:

- The PPL source codes.
- A PDF file of the generated theoretical APT.

<h2>Math </h2>
The math.par file is a simple implementation of a math library in the PPL. It contains only functions used by the benchmarks and replaces the standard library.
